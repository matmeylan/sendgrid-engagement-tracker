# Secrets defined here are available for reference under registry/password, env/secret, builder/secrets,
# and accessories/*/env/secret in config/deploy.yml. All secrets should be pulled from either
# password manager, ENV, or a file. DO NOT ENTER RAW CREDENTIALS HERE! This file needs to be safe for git.

# Option 1: Read secrets from the environment
# KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD

# Option 2: Read secrets via a command
# RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)

# Option 3: Read secrets via kamal secrets helpers
# These will handle logging in and fetching the secrets in as few calls as possible
# There are adapters for 1Password, LastPass + Bitwarden

# we use 1password CLI to access the deploy secrets, kamal 1password adapter seems broken: https://github.com/basecamp/kamal/issues/1007
